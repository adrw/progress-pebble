# Progress for Pebble
For millions of people who bike, run, or swim with non-smart tracking devices, there is rarely a way to extract or analyse this data.

After writing my ride stats in a text file for a month, I realized that this would be a great simple app to have on my Pebble. 

Currently in development, the following are roadmap todos:
- [ ] Configure basic list UI on Pebble
- [ ] Create input form for saving data on Pebble
- [ ] Create statistics calculations and UI
- [ ] Setup Firebase database to keep and serve data
- [ ] Push data from Pebble to Firebase
- [ ] Query Firebase and pull data to Pebble
- [ ] Create password/unique identifier to differentiate data
